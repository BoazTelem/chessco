# Chessco — Phased Build Plan

**Domain:** chessco.org • **Slogan:** _Scout. Prepare. Win._ • **Spec:** [chessco-full-spec.md v1.1](chessco-full-spec.md) (2026-05-11)

---

## Context

Chessco is a chess preparation and sparring platform with three integrated capabilities:

1. **Player discovery** — name-anchored identification: search official OTB rating lists (FIDE, USCF, national federations) first, then match to online Lichess / chess.com accounts. Style fingerprint is a verifier, not the primary search axis.
2. **Opponent preparation** — per-opponent battle plans showing repertoire, leaks, and exploitable lines vs. the user's own play.
3. **Paid sparring marketplace** — publish a starting position and pay a fixed fee per game; verified human opponents play it with you, paid for completing the session.

This plan executes the build from zero to revenue, mapped to spec v1.1. The architectural change from v1.0 → v1.1 (name-anchored over style-anchored, validated by SnoopChess's product) reorders the phases: FIDE ingestion ships in Phase 0, identification + prep ship together in Phase 1, and embeddings move to Phase 2.

**Why now:** Lichess/chess.com have games but no prep tools. ChessBase has prep tools but is desktop-only, $300+, master-level. SnoopChess does player discovery only — name-anchored heuristics, no AI on play patterns (internal teardown: [competitors.md](competitors.md)). No one ties discovery → prep → practice → paid sparring into a single loop, and no one runs AI stylometric matching from sample games. That's the gap, and the integrated loop (Scout → Find → Practice → Pay → Improve) plus the AI Scout engine is the moat.

## Current Status (2026-05-14)

> **Audit note (2026-05-14):** This section was reconciled against the codebase today. Phase 3 marketplace MVP is largely shipped under the `/practice` routing (not `/challenges` — see "Naming divergences" below). The AI/SEO discoverability bundle (Phase 1 W2) **shipped 2026-05-14** (commit `4dc5a88`) — robots.ts, sitemap.ts, JSON-LD, llms.txt, dynamic OG cards, plus friendly slug routing for `/p/[id]`. See "Untouched phases & quick wins" at the end of this doc for the remaining gap report.

- ✅ **Phase 0 Weeks 1–5 complete.**
  - W1 monorepo + brand tokens
  - W2 schema (31 migrations, 0001–0031, RLS, pg_trgm, pgvector) live in Supabase (eu-central-1, single project — staging dropped per cost call)
  - W3 Supabase Auth + Google OAuth + magic link + email/password (Apple still parked — verified 2026-05-14, see `apps/web/app/(auth)/actions.ts:133`)
  - W4 Lichess OAuth (PKCE) + Chess.com bio-token linking; validated end-to-end on `chessco.org` (production)
  - W5 FIDE ingestion: 755,081 players in production DB
- ✅ **Phase 0 Week 6 complete.**
  - `/scout` MVP + `/p/[player_id]` profile page live
  - Israeli CF (ICF) ingestion shipped early (was W7 target): 6,818 ICF players in production
- 🔄 **Phase 0 Week 7 — partially shipped (audit 2026-05-14).**
  - **USCF Playwright worker — scaffolded, but Cloudflare wall harder than hoped (2026-05-13 verification):** worker code (`apps/workers/src/uscf/`) is ready (categories list, scrape, dedupe + upsert, orchestrator, CLI, Cloud Run dispatcher, Dockerfile.uscf). Verified locally: even **real Chrome (channel: 'chrome') + `playwright-extra` stealth plugin + `webdriver=false` patch returns HTTP 403** with a Cloudflare "Just a moment…" challenge across every uschess.org endpoint (www, msa, new). USCF is on an enterprise-tier bot-management ruleset that's not defeated by client-side stealth alone. **Tactical fallback in place:** FIDE country='USA' already gives us **13,220** USA-rated players (1,038 titled, 2,802 rated 2000+) — the federation-anchored use case (titled + serious tournament players) is largely covered without USCF. **Strategic options to revisit later:** (a) paid Cloudflare bypass service (FlareSolverr / ScraperAPI / Bright Data, $30–200/mo), (b) commercial residential proxy pool, (c) USCF-issued API access. Worker stays unblocked behind `USCF_CLOUD_RUN_JOB_NAME` env so flipping to a paid-bypass image later is a one-line change. Re-evaluate when paid-launch demand confirms US TAM.
  - **ICF enrichment shipped:** `apps/workers/src/icf/enrich.ts` crawls `Player.aspx?Id=X` for rapid/blitz/title/English-transliteration/birth-year. Idempotent; orders by `raw.last_enriched_at NULLS FIRST` so each tick walks the corpus. Daily Inngest cron (`0 4 * * *`) caps each run at 1000 rows (~16 min @ 1 req/s); full ~7k corpus enriches over ~7 ticks.
  - **Federation cron infrastructure:** Inngest registered for FIDE / ICF rankings / ICF enrichment / USCF monthly schedules. Per-federation cron expressions defined in the "Federation cron registry" section below. All workers continue logging into `ingestion_runs` (new worker codes: `icf-enrich`).
  - **Cloud Run Jobs dispatcher** (`apps/workers/src/inngest/cloud-run-jobs.ts`): Inngest functions can hand off heavy or Playwright-bound workers to dedicated Cloud Run jobs over HTTPS, authed via Application Default Credentials. Fire-and-forget — the job writes its own `ingestion_runs` row.
  - **Country code normalization:** new `country_iso2(text)` SQL function + functional index converts FIDE alpha-3 ("USA"/"ISR") and ISO-2 ("US"/"IL") to a common form. `search_federation_players` now normalizes both sides so a "USA" filter hits USCF + FIDE-USA rows together.
  - **/scout federation filter:** new chip surfaces FIDE / USCF / ICF results separately; result card carries a federation badge and a federation-aware ID label.
  - **Apple OAuth + own-game PGN import:** rolled into the Phase 0 cleanup sprint before Phase 1 W10 paid launch (see `phase_0_polish_deferred.md`).
- 🔄 **DNS for chessco.org**: nameservers delegated to Vercel, propagation in progress (slow GoDaddy TTLs).
- 🔄 **Scope decisions locked 2026-05-12** (separate plan file in `~/.claude/plans/`):
  - Games corpus → **dedicated Google Cloud SQL** (existing GCP account) in europe-west3 (Frankfurt) (Phase 1 W1)
  - Chess.com → lazy fetch + 7d cache (spec default)
  - ChessBase → never a data source (licensing); free profile pages OK in Phase 2
- 🎯 **Strategic pivot 2026-05-12: skip Phase 0 polish, jump to Phase 1 W1.** Stage 3 stylometric AI is the headline product (see new `~/.claude/plans/i-want-to-build-generic-ladybug.md` v2 plan). Direct line to it is Phase 1 W1 (Cloud SQL + Lichess monthly dumps + games-corpus schema migration). Deferred Phase 0 polish items tracked in memory:
  - `phase_0_polish_deferred.md` — own-game import, Apple OAuth, USCF Playwright (all defer to a "Phase 0 cleanup sprint" before paid launch at Phase 1 W10)
  - `lichess_dump_compute_decision.md` — Cloud Run vs local vs alternative; decide before writing the W1 worker
- 🔄 **Phase 1 W5 — landing in parallel (2026-05-12 → 2026-05-13).** Sample-game scout pipeline picking up early stylometric features ahead of full Phase 1 W1 corpus:
  - Stockfish corpus backfill + cp-loss feature in matcher (commit `4d2f5da`)
  - Chess.com crawler prioritizes `archive_month` over `archives_list` so games flow continuously (commit `b919af1`)
  - Opening move-sequence fingerprint + LLM rerank + verdict on candidate cards (commit `1728ccf`)
  - Lives on the per-player sample-game path (`/p/[id]` → SampleGameForm → `/scout/match/[id]`); the main `/scout` name search remains Stage 1 + cached Stage 2 per spec.
- ✅ **Phase 1 W1 web track shipped (audit 2026-05-14).** 3-pillar homepage (`apps/web/app/page.tsx`), `/prepare/page.tsx` + `/api/prepare/verify`, stub `/prepare/[platform]/[handle]/page.tsx` with chess.com PubAPI opening-tree section, migration `0019_marketplace_waitlist.sql`, `/api/waitlist/position-practice`. Cloud SQL provisioning + Lichess dumps worker code (`apps/workers/src/lichess-dumps/`) scaffolded but no evidence of production runs yet.
- ✅ **Phase 3 marketplace MVP substantially shipped under `/practice` routing (audit 2026-05-14).** This is the biggest divergence between PLAN and reality: instead of `/challenges` + `/sparring` + `/inbox` as separate surfaces, the codebase ships a unified `/practice` lobby + `/practice/create` builder + `/practice/g/[id]` live game room (Fly.io WebSocket via `apps/realtime/`, Realtime presence + lobby updates, server-authoritative clocks, `match_moves` recording, `fairplay_telemetry` writes). Soft-launched on **credits** (`0031_credits_no_free_publishing.sql`, `funding_type` column) instead of real money so Stripe + KYC remain Phase 4 work. Migrations 0024–0031 carry the marketplace schema deltas. **Phase 3 deliverables not yet shipped:** `/sparring` directory + opt-in panel, dedicated `challenge_invitations` table, `player_sparring_profiles`/`player_sparring_fees` tables, `/inbox/invitations` page (verified 2026-05-14: tables NOT present in migrations).
- ✅ **AI / search discoverability bundle shipped 2026-05-14 (commit `4dc5a88`).** All Phase 1 W2 items landed: `apps/web/app/robots.ts` (allowlists GPTBot/ClaudeBot/PerplexityBot/Google-Extended/OAI-SearchBot/Bingbot), `apps/web/app/sitemap.ts` (Next 15 `generateSitemaps()` chunked at 50k URLs — ~16 federation chunks + ~3 platform chunks + 1 static), Person JSON-LD on `/p/[id]`, Organization + WebSite + SearchAction on `/`, `apps/web/app/llms.txt/route.ts` per llmstxt.org. Two add-ons beyond the original plan: (a) friendly slug routing `/p/{kebab-name}-{fed}-{id}` (e.g. `/p/telem-boaz-fide-2860740`) with UUID URLs 308-redirecting to canonical slug — major CTR win over UUID URLs; (b) dynamic OG cards (1200×630) per `/p/[id]` and `/prepare/[handle]` so chat/social shares render player name + ratings instead of a blank. **Decision (still locked):** skip per-player `/llms.txt`; serve site-wide `/llms.txt` only. **Open follow-ups:** submit sitemap to Google Search Console + Bing Webmaster + IndexNow on next deploy; track ≥80% indexed in 30 days per W2 gate.
- ⏭ **Next code work:** finish Cloud SQL provisioning → Lichess dumps live → resume Phase 1 W7 leak detection → `/reports/*` builder UI (Phase 1 W9, table already exists).

| 5    | **FIDE ratings ingestion worker** (Inngest, monthly cron `0 4 5 * *` + manual trigger). Stream-parse XML, batch upsert 1000 rows at a time, write `federation_rating_snapshots` for ratings/title changes. Implementation per [`fide-ingestion-spec.md`](fide-ingestion-spec.md). USCF top-list ingest if scope allows; else slip to Phase 1.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 6    | Federation search MVP at `/scout` — trigram-fuzzy name + country/title/rating filters against `federation_players` (now 755k FIDE players + USCF added this week). **USCF top-list ingestion worker** — HTML scrape of public USCF top lists (no clean XML dump unlike FIDE). PGN import worker (Inngest) — pull last 200 games from each linked Lichess/chess.com account, parse, intern positions, write `games` + `moves` into Supabase for now (will migrate to Google Cloud SQL games DB in Phase 1 W1). Backfill `external_accounts.rating_*` fields. |
| 7    | **Israeli Chess Federation (ICF) ingest** — HTML scrape of `chess.org.il` ratings (~30k players; primary launch market). `/account` polish, marketing site placeholder home page, deployment hardening, **Apple OAuth** (deferred from W3 — mirror the Google `signInWithGoogle` pattern; needs Apple Developer Service ID + .p8 key), Phase 0 retro. **Note:** /dashboard own-games and /p/[player_id] profile pages move into W6 since they're tightly coupled to /scout (click result → profile) and own-game import.                                    |

**Exit criteria:**

- A non-engineer can sign up, link Lichess, and see their last 200 games rendered as cards within 90 seconds.
- FIDE ingestion has run successfully and `federation_players` has ~400k rows.
- `/scout` returns Magnus Carlsen as top hit for query "magnus carlsen" in <100ms.
- Schema deployed in prod. Zero Sentry errors in a clean signup→link→view flow.

**Out of scope:** prep reports, online-account matching, marketplace, payments.

**Why FIDE first.** Federation rating list is the canonical anchor for all of Feature 1. Small (~400k records), structured, free, monthly cadence. Without it, the system has no way to ground "real-world player" → "online account" matches.

## National Federations Coverage Roadmap

Every national federation needs a custom HTML scraper because they all publish ratings differently — there's no shared standard. Each parser is ~150–250 LOC and reuses the upsert/normalize/run-tracker code from the FIDE worker. Average effort per federation: **~3–5 days** (research source + write parser + run + verify).

Each row below is a separate `apps/workers/src/<federation>/` worker.

### Priority-ordered sequence (locked 2026-05-12, cron column added 2026-05-13)

Single ordered list — every federation we'll ship, in the order we'll ship them. From Phase 1 onward, ~1 federation parser ships per engineer-week alongside the core feature work for that phase. Cadence adjusts to user-country distribution: if many sign-ups come from a not-yet-shipped country, that federation jumps the queue.

**Columns:**

- **Source** — public rating-list page. Where two URLs are listed, the second is the dump/CSV/API variant when one exists.
- **Format** — `xml` (FIDE), `csv`, `html` (server-rendered), `aspx-viewstate` (ASP.NET WebForms with `__doPostBack`), `spa` (client-rendered, needs Playwright), `cf-html` (HTML behind Cloudflare managed challenge, needs Playwright + stealth).
- **Bot wall** — `none`, `rate-limit`, `cloudflare`, `recaptcha`, `auth-gate` (paid membership required for full directory).
- **Scrape** — `fetch` (cheerio + node-fetch), `playwright` (Cloud Run job, headless Chromium), `api` (documented JSON endpoint), `dump` (downloadable XML/CSV).
- **Cron** — cron expression used by the Inngest scheduled function (UTC). All monthly federations stagger on different days so workers don't overlap.

**Source URLs above are best-known starting points and must be confirmed when each parser is built.** Federations rename URLs / migrate to subdomains often; expect ~10% of these to need correction at build time. The URL stored in `federations.rating_list_url` is the canonical record — update there when corrected, not just in PLAN.md.

**Total Phase 1 federations: 10 (entries #4–13).** Phase 1 stretches to accommodate one federation parser per week alongside the prep-report core work. This means Phase 1's W1 work (Cloud SQL provisioning + Lichess dumps) does NOT pause for federation work; they run in parallel as separate tracks. Adjust estimated Phase 1 duration accordingly: 10 weeks of core + 10 weeks of federation tracks ran in parallel by one engineer = realistic at ~10–13 weeks total; with two engineers, ~10 weeks.

### Phase 0 W7 expansion — full FIDE-handbook sweep (2026-05-14)

The row-by-row table above (#1–52) is the original order-of-shipment for bespoke per-federation scrapers. As of 2026-05-14 we widen scope to **all ~199 FIDE-recognized national federations** for SEO surface + immediate roster coverage.

Foundation shipped this PR (Phase 0 W7):

- **Directory const** at `apps/workers/src/lib/federations/directory.ts` — 207 entries with FIDE code, ISO alpha-2/alpha-3, continent, rating-list URL (where known), scrape-strategy hint, est. player count, sync cadence. Source: FIDE handbook "F. Federations Directory".
- **Migration `0032_seed_full_federation_directory.sql`** — additive columns on `federations` (iso2/iso3/continent/scrape_strategy/est_player_count/notes), `semi_annual` added to the sync_cadence CHECK, idempotent seed of all 207 rows with `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` that preserves `active` on existing rows.
- **Generic scraper framework** at `apps/workers/src/lib/{run-tracker,upsert-federation-players,run-federation-ingest,normalize-name,cheerio-pagination,aspnet-pagination,playwright-table,federations/registry}.ts` — the shared 90% of FIDE/ICF/USCF promoted to reusable lib code. Each Phase-B wave ships a `FederationIngestPipeline` (~30–80 LOC) and registers it in `registry.ts`.
- **Dynamic /scout filter chip** — federation `<select>` now loads all 207 rows from the DB, grouped by continent in `<optgroup>` (Europe / North America / South America / Asia / Africa / Oceania), sorted by est_player_count DESC. Inactive federations get a `· FIDE-only` suffix.
- **`/scout/federation/[code]` SSR roster pages** — one route for every federation. Three banner states: green (live native data, e.g. FIDE/ICF), amber (FIDE slice — federation has no native scraper yet but FIDE rates its players), grey (no FIDE coverage either). Static-generated for `active=true` federations; ISR (revalidate=86400) for the rest. JSON-LD `Organization` + `ItemList` per page. FIDE alpha-3 aliases (USA→USCF, ENG→ECF, GER→DSB, FRA→FFE, ITA→FSI, ISR→ICF) 301-redirect to canonical code.
- **Sitemap** — extended `apps/web/app/sitemap.ts` static chunk (id=0) with all 207 federation URLs.

**Total: ~25–30 calendar weeks (~6–7 months)** for one engineer working federations 60–70% time alongside other Phase-1 work; **~14–18 weeks (4 months)** with two engineers in parallel.

Per-wave per-fed checklist: verify URL → inspect HTML/network → write `apps/workers/src/<code>/scrape.ts` using cluster helpers → register pipeline in `registry.ts` → flip `federations.active = true` via `NNNN_activate_<code>.sql` → manual smoke run → roster page auto-flips from amber to green.

### Federation cron registry

**Locked 2026-05-13.** All federation ingest workers run as Inngest scheduled functions registered in `apps/workers/src/inngest/federations.ts`. The schedule is a single source of truth:

- One cron expression per federation, defined in the roadmap table above and mirrored in the Inngest function's `cron` field.
- Every cron tick inserts a row into `ingestion_runs` with `triggered_by = 'cron'` before scraping starts; status flips `running → completed | failed` at the end.
- Staggering rules:
  1. Monthly federations: one per day, between the 5th and 24th of the month, hour offset = (day mod 24) UTC. Keeps any two from overlapping. No worker fires before the 5th (FIDE list itself drops on the 1st but with a ~3-day stabilization window).
  2. Quarterly federations: run on the 1st of Jan/Apr/Jul/Oct (cron `0 H 1 */3 *`), one per hour UTC.
  3. Semi-annual federations: run on the 1st of Jan/Jul (cron `0 H 1 */6 *`).
- **Concurrency cap**: Inngest function config sets `concurrency: { limit: 4 }` so the long-tail of federations sharing the same cron minute still serialize cleanly.
- **Retry policy**: default Inngest retries (4 attempts, exponential backoff). Workers must be idempotent — every parser keys upserts on `(federation_id, federation_player_id)`. ICF and FIDE already are.
- **Manual override**: each worker keeps its CLI entry (`pnpm fide:ingest` etc.) and an admin button at `/admin/ingestion` (Phase 0 W7 admin page, deferred to Phase 0 cleanup) calling the Inngest function with `triggeredBy: 'admin'`. Both paths share the same orchestrator function — the only difference is the `ingestion_runs.triggered_by` column.
- **Cloudflare-walled federations (`scrape: playwright` with bot wall = `cloudflare`)** are deployed as a separate Cloud Run job dispatched by the Inngest function via the Cloud Run Jobs `:run` API, authed with Application Default Credentials (Inngest service account is granted `roles/run.invoker` on each target job). Dispatch is fire-and-forget — the job opens its own postgres connection, writes its own `ingestion_runs` row, and exits. The Inngest function returns the operation name and finishes in seconds. Implementation: `apps/workers/src/inngest/cloud-run-jobs.ts`. Env contract per federation: `<FED>_CLOUD_RUN_PROJECT_ID` / `<FED>_CLOUD_RUN_REGION` / `<FED>_CLOUD_RUN_JOB_NAME`; missing env triggers an inline fallback run (used in local dev). Cold-start ~15 s; USCF top-lists run ~3 min.
- **Per-player enrichment workers** (e.g. ICF `enrich.ts`) run on their own daily cron (`0 4 * * *`). They consume the most-stale rows from the same `federation_players` table the rankings ingest populates. Worker name is suffixed: e.g. `icf-enrich`, distinct from the rankings worker `icf`, so admin queries by `worker` can separate the two.
- **Discovery**: a follow-up Inngest cron (`0 3 * * 1`, Mondays) writes a Slack-equivalent summary row of last-week run metrics into `ingestion_runs` for the admin dashboard.

The table in the previous section is the authoritative cron schedule. Every row that ships a worker also updates `federations.active = true` in the DB and confirms the `rating_list_url` matches the URL the worker is hitting.

### Strategy notes

- **Source-of-truth check before each parser:** confirm public rating lists are accessible without auth + ToS allows scraping. Some federations (e.g. USCF full directory) gate behind paid membership — we settle for top lists. A few aggregator sites (e.g. ratings.fide.com mirrors national data) but first-party is more reliable.
- **All federation workers share infrastructure:** `apps/workers/src/lib/run-tracker.ts` (ingestion_runs row management), `apps/workers/src/fide/normalize.ts` (re-exported as `apps/workers/src/lib/normalize.ts` after USCF), `apps/workers/src/fide/upsert.ts` (UNNEST batch upsert pattern, abstracted into `lib/`).
- **The `federation_players.federation_id` column already supports this** — we seeded 6 federation rows in 0001_core_schema.sql; we add more rows via UPDATE/INSERT as parsers ship. No new tables needed.
- **Ratings differ across federations:** USCF has `rating_quick`, German has DWZ (different scale), correspondence federations have separate pools. The `federation_players.raw jsonb` column captures the original record so we don't lose precision.
- **Privacy posture:** federations differ on what data is publicly published. Where age/birth year or contact info is private, we omit it. Right-to-delist applies uniformly (spec §6 privacy defaults).

## Ongoing Data Ingestion (steady-state, post-launch)

Per-query lazy fetches (chess.com), monthly batch refreshes (FIDE / federations), and weekly tournament feeds keep the corpus current. These workers run 24/7 once Phase 1 launches.

### Chess.com continuous coverage (priority-queue crawler)

Spec §6 default is lazy-fetch-per-query, which serves the immediate user. **The longer game is continuous background crawling** to widen coverage so most queries hit a warm cache.

**Approach:**

- New table `chesscom_crawl_queue` (id, handle, priority int, reason text, last_attempted_at, next_attempt_at, status enum). Workers dequeue by `priority DESC, next_attempt_at ASC`.
- **Priority feeders** (initial seeds, ongoing additions):
  1. All FIDE-titled players with `chess_title IS NOT NULL` + their candidate chess.com handles (from Stage 2 matching)
  2. All linked external_accounts (`SELECT external_id FROM external_accounts WHERE platform = 'chess.com'`)
  3. All players who were targets of `identification_queries` in the last 90 days
  4. Top 1000 chess.com rated players globally + per-country top-100 (via chess.com's leaderboard endpoints)
  5. Opponents of any indexed game (transitively grow the graph)
- **Worker loop:** every 60s, dequeue 30 handles → fetch via PubAPI → write `games` + update `external_accounts.last_synced_at` → re-enqueue with `next_attempt_at = NOW() + 7 days` (or longer for inactive accounts).
- **Rate limit:** token-bucket capped at 30 req/min globally (chess.com's documented limit). Single Cloud Run worker; not parallelizable across IPs without proxies, which we won't do (against the spirit of their rate limits).
- **Storage:** all games → Cloud SQL games DB (provisioned Phase 1 W1).
- **ToS posture:** chess.com PubAPI is explicitly free for read-only public-data access; we attribute games to the chess.com URL in any rendered context per their attribution requirement.

**Ships:** **Phase 2 W1** as a follow-on to the Phase 1 lazy fetcher. The Phase 1 fetcher establishes the per-query path; Phase 2 adds the continuous queue + worker on top.

**Honest cap:** at 30 req/min, ~1.5M player profiles/year max. We will never cover all 150M chess.com users. We cover the ones that matter — titled players, active competitors, opponents of indexed games. The corpus grows organically with user demand.

### ChessBase free player profile pages

ChessBase publishes free public profile pages at `chessbase.com/en/players/{slug}` for prominent players (titled, World Championship participants, top-100, etc.). These pages contain:

- Player bio + photo
- Career highlights + tournament results
- Selected recent games (typically 10–50 per player, PGN downloadable)

**These are legal to fetch and render** (public marketing pages, not the licensed Mega Database). What's NOT legal is the Mega Database itself (paid product, EULA forbids redistribution).

**Approach:**

- New worker `apps/workers/src/chessbase/` — scrape free player profile pages for FIDE-titled players.
- Respect robots.txt; one request every 5s (conservative; their site doesn't publish a rate limit).
- Parse PGN sections, write games to Cloud SQL games DB tagged `source = 'chessbase'`.
- Cross-reference with the same player on Lichess/chess.com — these games may overlap with master databases already in the Lichess corpus, but the comments/annotations on ChessBase pages are sometimes unique.

**Ships:** **Phase 2 W2** alongside other Tier 2 enrichments. Low priority — the Lichess dumps already include most high-profile games via TWIC re-publication. ChessBase is a coverage-quality booster, not a primary source.

**Honest cap:** ~3–5k notable players have ChessBase profile pages with games. We're not building a competitor to ChessBase Mega — we're enriching our existing corpus with the small subset of public material they publish.

### TWIC (The Week in Chess) — weekly tournament games

TWIC publishes a weekly PGN file (~3k games/week) of top-level tournaments — the same games that flow into ChessBase Mega and Lichess master databases. Free, well-structured, no auth.

**Approach:**

- Weekly Inngest cron `0 6 * * 1` (Mondays 06:00 UTC)
- Download the week's TWIC PGN bundle from theweekinchess.com
- Parse and write to games DB with `source = 'twic'` + tournament metadata
- Players auto-resolved to canonical `players` rows by FIDE ID where present

**Ships:** **Phase 1 W2** as a third source alongside Lichess dumps and chess.com PubAPI. ~150k games/year, ~15GB total — trivial volume.

| 1    | **Provision Google Cloud SQL Postgres in europe-west3** (Frankfurt) — db-custom-2-7680 starter (~$70/mo), enterprise-plus tier later as corpus grows. Decision locked 2026-05-12: Supabase Pro 8GB can't hold 400–600GB Lichess corpus; user has existing GCP account so Cloud SQL chosen over AWS RDS. Migrate `games` / `positions` / `moves` / `player_position_stats` / `player_opening_stats` schema to Cloud SQL. Extend `apps/workers/src/db.ts` with a second connection (`GAMES_DATABASE_URL`). **Lichess monthly DB dump ingestion** (Inngest worker) — filter rated games ≥ 1500 in last 24 months, parse with `pgn-extract` or `python-chess`, dedupe via `(source, source_game_id)`, write to partitioned `games` on Cloud SQL. Token-bucket rate limiter (60/min Lichess) for live API. **+ Homepage 3-pillar IA** (parallel web track, ~1 dev-day): rewrite `apps/web/app/page.tsx` to expose Scout / Prepare / Practice-from-a-position as three standalone entries; new `apps/web/app/prepare/page.tsx` + `/api/prepare/verify` route reusing `lib/scout/lazy-probe.ts` primitives (`probeChesscomOne`, `probeLichess`, `upsertProbeHits`); stub `/prepare/[platform]/[handle]/page.tsx` renderer (real tree lands W6, real leaks land W7). Migration `0019_marketplace_waitlist.sql` + `/api/waitlist/position-practice` capture interest for Feature 3 (Phase 3). |
| 2    | Chess.com PubAPI on-demand fetcher with 7-day cache. Per-player monthly archive fetch, parse, write to `games`. Token-bucket rate limiter (30/min chess.com). **+ AI / search discoverability bundle** (parallel web track, ~1 dev-day): `apps/web/app/robots.ts` with explicit allow for `GPTBot`, `ClaudeBot`, `PerplexityBot`, `Google-Extended`, `OAI-SearchBot`, `Bingbot`, plus disallow on auth-only routes; dynamic `apps/web/app/sitemap.ts` enumerating `/`, `/scout`, and every `/p/[player_id]` (chunked into sitemap-index files of 50k URLs each — FIDE alone needs ~16 chunks); JSON-LD `Person` schema on `/p/[player_id]` (name, FIDE/federation ID, ratings, country, title, birth year, `sameAs` to ratings.fide.com); JSON-LD `Organization` + `WebSite` + `SearchAction` on `/`; root `apps/web/app/llms.txt/route.ts` per llmstxt.org standard (site overview + key URLs: `/scout`, `/p/[id]`, `/scout/match/[id]`; markets served). Submit sitemap to Google Search Console + Bing Webmaster + IndexNow on first deploy. **+ Upgrade `/prepare/[platform]/[handle]` stub** toward the W6 aggregation source — back the tree placeholder with chess.com PubAPI archive (≤50 most recent games, top-20 first moves) for the logged-out tree-only view so the demo wedge is live before the full builder lands.                                                  |
| 3    | **Stage 2 matching pipeline** (online accounts per federation anchor) — fuzzy handle search via pg_trgm on `external_accounts.handle`, country filter, rating-band correlation (online blitz/rapid within ±300 of FIDE standard). Up to 10 candidate handles per anchor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

## Phase 3 — Marketplace MVP, No Real Money (11–13 weeks)

**Goal:** Internal users publish position-based challenges with full discovery (public/unlisted/private+invites), a two-sided directory pairs publishers' budgets with paid players' per-time-class fees, and matches play end-to-end on the live game server. Telemetry lit up. **No payments yet — wallet uses play money.**

Matching model is **fixed-fee, first-accept**: publisher sets a max budget per game, any eligible online player whose advertised fee for the time class is ≤ budget can accept; first to click wins. Player ranking on the "Suggested players" panel is **position-fit primary**, leaning on `player_position_stats` + `player_opening_stats` (Phase 1 W6).

Supabase Realtime channels scaffolded: `challenges:lobby` (server-filtered to `status='open' AND visibility IN ('public','unlisted')`) and `sparring:online` presence. **RLS:** private challenges visible only to creator + invitees; unlisted hidden from list endpoints, accessible by direct link only. |

**Exit criteria:** Two internal users can publish + accept + play a full game on Fly.io with no desync, server-authoritative clocks holding under load. Telemetry rows populating. Post-game review accurate. Publishing public + unlisted + private+invite challenges all work end-to-end; private challenges never appear in `/challenges` lobby for non-invitees (verified by RLS test). An opted-in sparring player sees ≥1 eligible position in their `/p/[id]` "Positions you can accept" section within 30s of a matching public challenge being posted. The "Suggested players" panel returns position-fit-ranked candidates in <2s for any FEN that exists in `positions`. Realtime presence shows accurate online state for ≥95% of opted-in players (verified by manual disconnect test).

- **`challenges.opening_eco`**, **`opening_name`**, **`starting_color`** denormalized from `positions` at insert time for filterable lobby queries.
- **`challenge_invitations`** — `(id, challenge_id FK, invited_user_id FK profiles, invited_by FK profiles, status enum 'pending'|'accepted'|'declined'|'expired'|'auto_declined', created_at, responded_at, expires_at)`. Unique `(challenge_id, invited_user_id)`.
- **`player_sparring_profiles`** — `(profile_id PK FK, listed bool, accepting_challenges bool, away_until ts null, accepted_time_classes text[], min_rating_band int, max_rating_band int, notes text, updated_at)`.
- **`player_sparring_fees`** — `(profile_id FK, time_class enum bullet|blitz|rapid|classical, fee_cents int, currency text, updated_at)`. PK `(profile_id, time_class)`.
- **RLS** — private challenges: select only by creator OR `auth.uid()` IN `(SELECT invited_user_id FROM challenge_invitations WHERE challenge_id = challenges.id AND status != 'auto_declined')`. Unlisted: select by anyone holding the id (no list scan), enforced at query layer rather than RLS.
- **Realtime channels** — `challenges:lobby` (server-filtered to `status='open' AND visibility IN ('public','unlisted')`), `sparring:online` presence, `inbox:{user_id}` for invitation notifications.

## Phase 4 — Real Payments & Marketplace Launch (6–8 weeks)

**Goal:** Marketplace goes live with real money in IL + EU + UK + CA + AU per §3.

| Week | Deliverables                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | **Stripe Connect Express** integration — onboarding redirect, capabilities `transfers` + `card_payments`, webhooks (`account.updated`, `transfer.created`, `payout.paid`, `payout.failed`, `charge.dispute.created`). MCC 8299 application coordinated with Stripe contact (Mitch).                                                                                              |
| 2    | **Double-entry ledger** — `ledger_entries` writes for every $ movement (deposit, escrow, payout, platform fee, withdrawal, refund). Daily reconciliation job: `sum(escrow) == sum(wallets.pending_cents)`.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 3    | Wallet UI — `/account/wallet` with balance, transaction history, deposit (Stripe Checkout), withdrawal. Pre-checks: KYC complete, balance sufficient, not under fairplay hold. Hold periods per trust tier (New/Bronze T+5d, Silver T+3d, Gold T+1d, Platinum T+0).                                                                                                              |
| 4    | **Escrow flow integrated with match lifecycle** — on accept: debit creator wallet → escrow; on settle: full escrow → opponent wallet (fee was already collected at deposit per migration 0022). Match state machine `accepted → starting → live → completed → settled` with 24h review window. Payout-hold: if opponent has open `user_reports`, route to escrow until resolved. |
| 5    | **Glicko-2 rating** implementation — separate ratings per time class, Bayesian prior from external account ratings, rating_history audit trail. Provisional badge when RD>100.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 6    | **Trust score** implementation per spec §10. Tier thresholds gate publish/accept caps. Decay rules (1pt/week after 90d inactive).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 7    | **Refund system** — categorical reason codes only (no free-text bypass), auto-resolution rules (opponent_abandoned + telemetry confirms → auto-approve; opponent_didnt_play_position + FEN mismatch → auto-approve). Admin queue at `/admin/refunds`.                                                                                                                            |
| 8    | **Geo-blocking** at marketplace surface (IP geolocation): allow IL/EU/UK/CA/AU; block IN/SA/AE for paid features; defer US state-by-state. **Legal review sign-off** required before launch. Phase 4 retro + soft launch.                                                                                                                                                        |

**Exit criteria:** Written legal opinion confirming non-gambling classification in launch jurisdictions. First 50 real-money matches completed and settled cleanly. Daily reconciliation passes 7 consecutive days. Zero stuck-escrow incidents.

---

## Phase 5 — Anti-Cheat & Trust Hardening (6–8 weeks)

**Goal:** Platform is trustworthy enough for higher-volume paid play.

| Week | Deliverables                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1–2  | **Post-game engine correlation** — re-analyze paid games at depths 12/18/25, compute engine match rate, compare against rating-appropriate baseline. Outlier detection writes `fairplay_flags`. |
| 3    | **Move time vs. complexity analyzer** — complexity score per position from engine workers; flag inverted thinking patterns.                                                                     |
| 4    | **Sandbagging detection** — new-account fast-rise + rating-platform discrepancy → review queue. Rating-band stretching capped at 1.5× external rating.                                          |
| 5    | `/admin/fairplay` queue — severity-sorted, with engine correlation chart, telemetry replay, game replay. Decision UI (confirm/dismiss + notes). Audit logged.                                   |
| 6    | Action stack per spec §12 (severity 1 log → 6+ permanent paid-play ban + payout forfeit). Hard KYC gate ≥$20 cumulative earnings; $50 cap without KYC.                                          |
| 7    | Player report button in game room + post-game. Reporter trust +1 if confirmed. Public ban list (opt-in transparency).                                                                           |
| 8    | Annual fair-play transparency report template. Phase 5 retro.                                                                                                                                   |

**Exit criteria:** Fairplay queue SLA <72h. False-positive rate <2% on confirmed-cheater eval set. Zero settled payouts to users with confirmed cheating in 30 days post-launch.

## Phase 6 — Style-Mimicking Bots & Coach Features (8–10 weeks)

**Goal:** Differentiated practice features that don't require paid opponents.

| Week | Deliverables                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1–3  | **Maia fine-tuning pipeline** — per-player model fine-tunes (offline job, hours per model), bot weights stored in Supabase Storage. Inference service hosted as a separate Cloud Run worker. |
| 4–5  | `/practice` drill mode — practice each recommended line from a prep report against the opponent's style bot. Subscription-gated.                                                             |
| 6    | Full-game sandbox vs. opponent-style bot.                                                                                                                                                    |
| 7    | Spectator mode — read-only WebSocket subscribers with 10-move delay (anti-coaching); verified silver+ get no-delay.                                                                          |
| 8–9  | **Coach accounts** — multi-student dashboards, assign prep reports to students, view student game history. New `coach_students` join table.                                                  |
| 10   | OTB tournament prep mode — FIDE ID integration, pre-tournament report bundle (build prep on all known pairings). Phase 6 retro.                                                              |

**Exit criteria:** Maia bots playable end-to-end. Coach accounts in use by ≥10 paying coaches.

---

## Phase 7+ — Scale, Internationalization, Ecosystem (ongoing)

- Localized UI (Hebrew, Spanish, German, French, Russian) — Next.js i18n routing
- Mobile app (React Native, shared logic via packages/)
- Tournament partnerships (federation deals)
- Streaming integrations (Twitch/YouTube overlay showing live prep cards)
- Public API for chess content creators
- US state-by-state legal expansion
- Bug bounty program (HackerOne) once volume justifies

---

## Marketing Site, Blog, KB, Legal, & Discoverability (parallel to Phases 1–4)

These do not block engineering phases but must be in flight:

- **Marketing site** (`/`, `/how-it-works`, `/pricing`, `/scout-preview`, `/for-coaches`, `/for-tournament-players`, `/about`, `/contact`) — built incrementally Phase 1 onward. Target Lighthouse ≥95 mobile/desktop, LCP <2s, fully SSG. Voice: direct/professional, banned vocab per §3 and §17. **Marketplace surfaces** (`/challenges`, `/challenges/new`, `/game/*`, `/account/wallet`) **use the sub-tagline "Practice the positions that matter" — "Win" cannot appear within two viewport-screens of any fee/payout amount** (spec §17).
- **Blog** (`content/blog/*.mdx`) — 2 articles/week for 6 months starting Phase 1 = 48 articles to build SEO base. Claude Sonnet first drafts, human-edited.
- **Knowledge base** (`content/kb/*.mdx`) — seed articles from §19 list, client-side search (Pagefind), in-app `?` links.
- **Legal pages** (`content/legal/*.mdx`) — Terms, Privacy (GDPR+CCPA), Refunds, Fair Play, Acceptable Use, Cookies, DPA. Draft by Boaz (existing GDPR DPA v4 template as base), counsel review before Phase 4 launch.
- **AI / search discoverability** — initial bundle ships Phase 1 W2 (see weekly table). Maintenance is ongoing across phases: extend JSON-LD schema as new entity types ship — `Person` on player profiles (P1 W2), `Article` on blog posts (P1 W2+), `CreativeWork`/`Report` on `/reports/[id]` (P1 W9), `Event` for tournament pages (P2 W7 `/scout/federation/{id}`), marketplace `Service` listings on `/challenges/[id]` (P3 W6 — review §17 copy compliance before exposing fee fields in structured data), `Person` (coach) on coach pages (P6 W8). Re-submit `sitemap.xml` to Google Search Console + Bing Webmaster + IndexNow on each new entity-type rollout. Quarterly: review AI-bot landscape and add newly-named UAs to `robots.txt` allow-list. **Owner:** whoever ships the entity-type owns its schema; reviewed in phase retros.

## Critical Files to Establish Early

These files are referenced by many later phases; get them right in Phase 0:

| Path                                 | Purpose                                                                                               |

| `packages/ui/theme.ts`               | Brand tokens — slate primary, amber accent, Inter + Geist fonts, **master + marketplace sub-tagline** |
| `apps/web/middleware.ts`             | Geo-blocking + jurisdiction routing                                                                   |
| `apps/web/app/robots.ts`             | `robots.txt` — explicit allow-list of AI crawler UAs (GPTBot, ClaudeBot, PerplexityBot, etc.)         |
| `apps/web/app/sitemap.ts`            | Dynamic `sitemap.xml` — `/`, `/scout`, chunked `/p/[player_id]` (50k URLs/chunk, sitemap-index)       |

## Verification (end-to-end at each phase gate)

**Phase 0 gate:**

- Manual: signup → link Lichess → see games. ≤90s.
- Manual: `/scout` for "magnus carlsen" returns Carlsen in <100ms.
- Automated: Playwright E2E covers signup, OAuth callback, dashboard render, scout search.
- DB: RLS proven by attempting cross-user row read (must fail). `federation_players` row count within 1% of FIDE published totals. `federations` table holds all ~200 FIDE-handbook entries; `/scout` chip lists every code; `/scout/federation/[code]` renders for every code (FIDE-slice fallback acceptable for `active=false`).

**Phase 1 gate:**

- Eval: identification top-1 accuracy ≥75% on 100-query labeled set (federation-anchored).
- Manual: generate prep report on a known Lichess player; PDF downloads; PGN imports cleanly into Lichess studies.
- Stripe: subscription checkout → access unlocked within 5s.
- Discoverability: `/sitemap.xml` enumerates 100% of live `/p/[player_id]` rows (chunked under the 50k-URL limit); `/robots.txt` allow-lists the named AI UAs; Google Search Console + Bing Webmaster show ≥80% of submitted `/p/*` URLs as "Indexed" 30 days after W2 ship; brand query "chessco" returns the site in ChatGPT/Claude/Perplexity within 60d.

**Phase 2 gate:**

- Eval: identification top-1 accuracy ≥80% on mixed 100-query set including anonymous-only queries.
- Manual: "find lookalikes" returns plausible matches for known multi-account users.
- Privacy: right-to-delist removes player from index within 5min.

**Phase 3 gate:**

- 20 internal users complete 50+ games without clock desync.
- Telemetry rows populating; no missing data on any completed match.
- Copy audit: zero instances of "win"/"won"/"winner" within two screens of any fee or payout amount on marketplace pages.

**Phase 4 gate:**

- Legal opinion in hand, signed.
- 7-day clean reconciliation (`escrow == sum(pending_cents)`).
- 50 real-money matches settled.
- Refund auto-resolution rate ≥60% on opponent_abandoned cases.

**Phase 5 gate:**

- Fairplay queue median resolution <48h.
- False-positive rate <2% on 50-case eval set.

**Phase 6 gate:**

- 10+ coaches using coach accounts.
- Maia bots playable; user-reported "feels like the real player" ≥3.5/5 in survey.

## Open Decisions (to lock during build, do not block start)

These are deferred to Boaz; the plan accommodates either resolution:

1. **Subscription pricing & tiers** — lock by Phase 1 week 8 (before subscription checkout ships). Suggest 3 tiers: Free (limited search, preview reports) / Solo $19/mo (unlimited reports, marketplace publish) / Pro $39/mo (priority queue + coach features).
2. **Trademark + .com acquisition** — name/domain/slogan locked; trademark search and chessco.com acquisition remain open.
3. **Entity structure** — separate company vs Foto Master subsidiary. Lock before Stripe MCC application (Phase 4 week 1).
4. **Co-founders / hiring** — solo or recruit CTO. Affects timeline ±50%.
5. **Funding** — bootstrap, pre-seed, or SAFE round. Lock before Phase 2 (vector model training + ingestion costs grow).
6. **Brand voice intensity** — direct/intense (Whoop-style) vs friendly/aspirational (Lichess-style). Lock before marketing site copy (Phase 1).
7. **Coach accounts timing** — Phase 1 or Phase 6+. Plan slots them in Phase 6.
8. **OTB / FIDE focus depth** — currently anchored in Phase 0–1. Whether to expand to ECF, DSB, etc. in Phase 2 or wait for launch demand.
9. **AI redundancy** — Anthropic-only or also OpenAI fallback. Plan is Anthropic-only.

## Risk Mitigations (top 6 from spec §26)

| Risk                                               | Mitigation in this plan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Gambling regulation                                | Completion-based payout enforced from copy through DB schema (no result-conditional payout fields). Marketplace copy rule (§17) enforced as Phase 3 gate. Legal review hard gate before Phase 4 launch.

## Naming divergences (codebase vs. PLAN)

Audit 2026-05-14 surfaced these mismatches between PLAN copy and what actually shipped. PLAN naming is kept for reference where the spec-level word matters (e.g. "challenges" in legal copy), but the codebase routes are what actually exist:

| PLAN name                            | Codebase reality                             | Decision                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `apps/gameserver/`                   | `apps/realtime/`                             | Codebase wins. Update spec/PLAN references to `apps/realtime/`.                                                                                                   |
| `/challenges`, `/challenges/new`     | `/practice`, `/practice/create`              | Codebase wins for marketplace lobby. Phase 6 "drill mode" name needs a different slug (proposed: `/drill` or `/practice/drill`) to avoid collision.               |
| `/game/[match_id]`, `/matches`       | `/practice/g/[id]`, `/account/history`       | Codebase wins.                                                                                                                                                    |
| `/sparring`, `/account/sparring`     | not shipped                                  | Defer until paid sparring directory becomes a real product surface (currently every challenge accepts any opt-in player by budget filter — directory not needed). |
| `/inbox/invitations`                 | not shipped                                  | Defer until private/invite-only challenges ship (today every challenge is `visibility='public'`-equivalent; `0031_challenge_target_opponent.sql` adds a hook).    |
| `challenge_invitations` table        | not shipped                                  | Defer with `/inbox/invitations`. `0031_challenge_target_opponent.sql` adds a single `target_opponent_id` column on `challenges` that covers 1-to-1 invites today. |
| `player_sparring_profiles` / `_fees` | not shipped                                  | Defer. Phase 4 work — meaningful only once per-time-class fees gate paid sparring.                                                                                |
| `coach_students` table (Phase 6)     | not shipped                                  | Phase 6 work; not started.                                                                                                                                        |
| Phase 6 `/practice` drill mode       | name collides with shipped marketplace lobby | Rename in PLAN to `/drill` or fold drill mode into `/practice/g/[id]` as a "vs. opponent-style bot" toggle.                                                       |

## Untouched phases & quick wins (audit 2026-05-14)

This is the gap report from auditing the codebase against PLAN today. The list below covers everything PLAN.md still treats as future work that has not been started.

### Critical path — start here

These three blocks block the next two product milestones (discoverability + paid launch). Quick wins are flagged with **QW**.

1. ✅ **AI / search discoverability bundle (Phase 1 W2 parallel) — shipped 2026-05-14 (commit `4dc5a88`).**
   - ✅ `apps/web/app/robots.ts` — allow-lists `GPTBot`, `ClaudeBot`, `PerplexityBot`, `Google-Extended`, `OAI-SearchBot`, `Bingbot`; disallows `/account`, `/admin`, `/api`, `/dashboard`, `/scout/history`, `/scout/match`, `/practice/g`, `/login`, `/signup`.
   - ✅ `apps/web/app/sitemap.ts` — Next 15 `generateSitemaps()` chunked at 50k URLs (1 static chunk + federation chunks for FIDE+ICF + platform chunks for chess.com+lichess). Daily ISR, 60s `maxDuration`. Pagination sub-chunks at 1k inside each 50k file to dodge the PostgREST max-rows default.
   - ✅ JSON-LD `Person` on `/p/[player_id]/page.tsx` via `lib/seo/jsonld.ts#personJsonLd` — `name`, `identifier` (`{FED}:{id}`), `award` (title), `nationality`, `birthDate`, `sameAs` (ratings.fide.com for FIDE), plus per-rating `additionalProperty` PropertyValue tiles.
   - ✅ JSON-LD `Organization` + `WebSite` + `SearchAction` on `apps/web/app/page.tsx` (SearchAction target = `/scout?q={search_term_string}`).
   - ✅ `apps/web/app/llms.txt/route.ts` — llmstxt.org-spec Markdown, weekly revalidate.
   - ✅ **Bonus add-on (not in original W2 scope):** friendly slug URLs — `/p/{kebab-name}-{fed}-{id}` (e.g. `/p/telem-boaz-fide-2860740`); UUID-form URLs `permanentRedirect()` (308) to canonical slug via `lib/seo/slug.ts` + `lib/seo/player-fetch.ts` (React `cache()`-wrapped so `generateMetadata` and the page share one Supabase round-trip per request).
   - ✅ **Bonus add-on:** dynamic OG cards (1200×630) per `/p/[id]` and `/prepare/[handle]` via `opengraph-image.tsx` files using `next/og` `ImageResponse`; prepare-card probe wrapped in 2s race with fallback so Twitter/Slack never time out on platform-API hiccups.
   - ✅ `generateMetadata` on `/p/[id]` (title pattern: `Scout {Display Name} chess accounts`) and `/prepare/[platform]/[handle]` (title pattern: `Prepare to play chess against {handle} ({chess.com|lichess.org})`).
   - 🔄 **Still to do:** submit sitemap to Google Search Console + Bing Webmaster Tools + IndexNow on next prod deploy; verify rich result eligibility via Google Rich Results Test on a slug URL; track ≥80% indexed in 30 days per W2 gate.

2. **Phase 1 W7 leak detection + W9 reports builder UI — 0% shipped.** Schema is ready (`prep_reports` table populated to `/account/history`); the builder + viewer UI is not.
   - `/reports/new` form (target player, opening filter, report config).
   - `/reports/[id]` interactive viewer with collapsible sections + embedded boards.
   - `/reports` index.
   - Leak detection algorithm per spec §7 step 2 (reachability + frequency + score gap + cp loss + user familiarity → severity score).
   - Recommended-line walker (2–4 sequences per leak).
   - PDF export via Playwright HTML→PDF; PGN export of recommended lines.
   - **QW within this block:** `/reports/[id]` read-only viewer rendering whatever the worker writes (1 dev-day) ships value before the leak detector is finalized.

3. **Stripe Billing subscription (Phase 1 W10) — 0% shipped.** No SDK in `package.json`, no webhook handlers, env vars present in `.env.example` but unused.
   - Required to validate willingness-to-pay before Phase 4 marketplace launch.
   - Ship the subscription gate on full reports (preview free; paid for full report + PDF).

### Phase 0 cleanup (deferred — not blocking)

4. **Apple OAuth** — pattern already commented in `apps/web/app/(auth)/actions.ts:133`. **QW: ~half a dev-day** once Apple Developer Service ID + .p8 key are in hand.
5. **Own-game PGN import** — referenced in `phase_0_polish_deferred.md`. Reuses the chess.com crawler's parse path. **QW: 1 dev-day.**
6. **USCF ingestion** — Cloudflare-blocked; verified 2026-05-13 ([USCF Cloudflare verified block](../memory/uscf_cloudflare_verified_block.md)). Worker stays parked behind `USCF_CLOUD_RUN_JOB_NAME` env until paid Cloudflare bypass (FlareSolverr / ScraperAPI) is contracted. FIDE-USA (13,220 rows) covers the federation-anchored use case in the meantime.

### Phase 1 federations not yet shipped (8 of 10)

7. **ECF, DSB, FFE, FSI, FEDA, CFC, ACF, KNSB, PZSZ, KBSB.** Each is ~3–5 dev-days (parser + verify). Only FIDE + ICF live; USCF blocked. Recommend prioritizing **DSB (Germany, ~110k DWZ)** and **FFE (France, ~57k)** first — both are fetch-only, no bot wall, and unlock the two largest EU markets after IL. **QW per federation: ~3 dev-days** because the upsert/normalize/run-tracker scaffolding from FIDE/ICF is reusable.

### Phase 1 ancillary workers

8. **TWIC weekly worker** (`apps/workers/src/twic/`) — weekly PGN bundle of top tournaments. **QW: 1 dev-day.** ~150k games/year, trivial volume.
9. **Claude prompt library** (`packages/ai/prompts/`) — currently `packages/ai/src/index.ts` declares model defaults but ships no prompts. Required before reports UI delivers value. **QW: 2 dev-days** to draft `prep_summary_v1.md`, `evidence_v1.md`, `style_fingerprint_v1.md`.

### Phase 2 — Identification depth (0% shipped)

10. Engineered feature extractor at scale (200–500 features per player) — partly underway in `apps/workers/src/features/`; verify coverage.
11. Embedding model training (small transformer encoder, contrastive loss). Offline pipeline + model versioning in `ops/models/` not started.
12. pgvector HNSW index on `players.embedding` — column not even created.
13. "Find lookalikes" cross-platform sibling-account check.
14. Style fingerprint UX (radar chart on 8 axes + Haiku prose summary).
15. `/scout/federation/[id]` ranked-list browse mode (also a **QW for SEO** — adds 100s of high-value pages: each federation × top-N).
16. Right-to-delist endpoint + hide-from-search flag on `federation_players`. **Privacy-critical; ship before any GDPR complaint.**
17. Tier 2 federations sweep (rows #14–37 of the federation roadmap).
18. Chess.com continuous crawl queue (`apps/workers/src/chesscom/crawl/`) — distinct from current `apps/workers/src/chesscom-crawl/` per-query fetcher (verify whether the existing dir already implements the queue or only the lazy fetcher).
19. ChessBase free profile pages worker (`apps/workers/src/chessbase/`).

### Phase 4 — Real payments (0% shipped beyond schema)

20. Stripe Connect Express onboarding + webhooks + MCC 8299 application.
21. Wallet UI (`/account/wallet`) — schema ready (`wallets`, `ledger_entries` tables exist from `0002_marketplace_wallet_fairplay.sql`), no UI.
22. Glicko-2 rating implementation — `ratings` table has `skill_rating`/`skill_rd`/`volatility` columns; no algorithm runs against them.
23. Trust score algorithm + tier gating — columns exist, logic does not.
24. Refund system + categorical reasons + auto-resolution + `/admin/refunds` queue.
25. Geo-blocking middleware (IL/EU/UK/CA/AU allow; IN/SA/UAE block for paid). **QW: ~1 dev-day** wrapping `apps/web/middleware.ts` around `geoip-lite` or Vercel's `request.geo`.
26. Legal opinion sign-off — non-engineering blocker; needs scheduling now if Phase 4 is to ship in 2026.

### Phase 5 — Anti-cheat & trust (telemetry collected, no analysis)

27. Post-game engine correlation (re-analyze paid games at depth 12/18/25, compute engine match rate vs. baseline). `fairplay_flags` table exists; no analysis worker.
28. Move-time-vs-complexity analyzer.
29. Sandbagging detector (new-account fast-rise + rating-platform discrepancy).
30. `/admin/fairplay` queue UI (severity-sorted, telemetry replay, decision UI).
31. Action stack per spec §12 (severity 1 log → 6+ permanent ban + payout forfeit).
32. Player report button in game room + post-game.
33. Public ban list (opt-in transparency).
34. Annual fair-play transparency report.

### Phase 6 — Bots & coach features (0% shipped)

35. Maia per-player fine-tuning pipeline + Cloud Run inference service.
36. Drill mode against opponent-style bot — **rename needed** (collides with `/practice` lobby; propose `/drill` or `/practice/g/[id]?bot=1`).
37. Full-game sandbox vs. style bot.
38. Spectator mode (read-only WebSocket subscribers, 10-move delay; verified silver+ no-delay).
39. Coach accounts + multi-student dashboards + `coach_students` join table.
40. OTB tournament prep mode (FIDE ID → bundle prep on all known pairings).

### Phase 7+ — Scale & ecosystem (not started)

41. i18n (Hebrew, Spanish, German, French, Russian) — Hebrew first (IL launch market).
42. React Native mobile app.
43. Federation partnerships, streaming integrations (Twitch/YouTube prep card overlay), public API for content creators, US state-by-state legal expansion, HackerOne bug bounty.

### Recommended order for the next 4 weeks (1 engineer)

1. **Week 1 (now):** Ship the AI/SEO bundle (#1) + geo-blocking middleware (#25) + Apple OAuth (#4) — three small wins that unblock discoverability, set up Phase 4 jurisdiction guards, and finish Phase 0 polish.
2. **Week 2:** Claude prompt library (#9) + `/reports/[id]` viewer skeleton (#2 partial) + DSB federation parser (#7).
3. **Week 3:** Leak detection algorithm (#2 main) + `/reports/new` form + own-game PGN import (#5).
4. **Week 4:** Stripe Billing subscription gate on `/reports/[id]` (#3) + FFE federation parser (#7) — ship soft launch to paid waitlist.

After this 4-week run, Phase 1 will be substantively complete and we can re-plan Phase 2 (identification depth) vs. Phase 4 (real-money marketplace) priority based on subscription conversion data.

**End of plan.**
